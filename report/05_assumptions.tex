\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

The models we present assume a single shared channel and $n$ stations, all in the communication range of each other.
Packets have exponential interarrival time of mean $\lambda^{-1}$.
$\mu$ indicates the average number of packets that exit the channel per unit of time.

To keep the model simple, we assume an exponential distribution with mean $s=746\, byte$ for the packets size.
Each station transmit at a data rate $r$ of $8\, Mbps$.
We assume that all packets are corrupted in case of collisions, i.e. when there is more than one packet on the channel.
